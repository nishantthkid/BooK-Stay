## Getting Started (The Fun Part!)

### What You'll Need
- Node.js (version 14 or newer)
- npm or yarn (your choice!)
- MongoDB (local setup or cloud)
- Git (for cloning the magic)

### Let's Build This Thing 🛠️

**1. Grab the Code**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bookandstay.git
cd bookandstay
```

**2. Backend Setup**
```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Set up your environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your secret sauce (see below)

# Fire up the server
npm run dev
```

**3. Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Launch the magic
npm start
```

**4. See It Live**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (where the magic happens)
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000 (the engine room)

## Environment Setup 🔧

Create a `.env` file in your backend folder with these secrets:

```env
# Your Database Connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://yourcluster.mongodb.net/bookstay

# JWT Magic Words
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_that_nobody_knows
JWT_EXPIRE=7d

# Server Configuration  
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Image Uploads (Cloudinary)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key  
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Email Notifications (Optional but Cool)
EMAIL_USER=hello@bookstay.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
```
